## General Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Ensure readability, maintainability, and modularity in all implementations.
- Write concise, well-commented code for clarity in development and debugging.
- Enforce consistent coding standards across all components.

### Technology Stack
- Use Python for backend logic and Streamlit for the frontend.
- Incorporate Firebase for authentication and secure data storage.
- Leverage IPFS for decentralized file storage.
- Enable dynamic updates with WebSocket or real-time data streaming.

### Project Structure
- Maintain a modular architecture:
  - **Frontend**: Use Streamlit or React-based components with a clear hierarchy.
  - **Backend**: Separate services (e.g., auth-service, storage-service).
  - **Shared Logic**: Centralize utilities like validation and data processing.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for each module or service.

## Code Style and Syntax

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards.
- Use type annotations for all variables and functions.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions.

### Streamlit
- Adopt declarative layouts for UI consistency.
- Apply Dracula Dark theme across components.
- Prioritize accessibility and responsive design.

---

## Data Management and Security

### Authentication
- Secure Firebase Authentication for managing user sessions.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.

### Data Storage
- Encrypt sensitive data before storage.
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing.

### File Storage
- Use IPFS for redundancy and decentralized access.
- Validate file integrity using checksum verification.

---

## UI/UX Design
- Implement a sidebar with clear navigation links.
- Offer real-time feedback during interactions (e.g., progress indicators).
- Meet accessibility standards to support diverse user needs.

---

## Performance and Optimization
- Minimize redundant renders and manage state effectively.
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Compress assets to reduce loading times.

---

## Error Handling
- Implement global error boundaries on the frontend.
- Centralize logging for backend errors (e.g., Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics).
- Manage network and input errors gracefully.

---

## Testing
- Write unit tests for backend logic and frontend components.
- Use integration tests to validate key workflows.
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing.

---

## Deployment and CI/CD
- Containerize services with Docker.
- Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions.
- Monitor and optimize live systems for performance.

---

## Documentation and Communication
- Maintain clear documentation for APIs, architecture, and deployment processes.
- Use inline comments to clarify complex logic.
- Share updates and key decisions regularly with the team.
